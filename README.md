# MequieApp

The project's main goal is to build a distributed application to run in a sandbox, focusing essentially on the functionalities of the application. The work consists of the implementation of the Mequie system, which is a client-server type system that allows users (clients) to use a central server to form user groups, through which they can chat and send photos to all users of these groups. Each user has an account on the server and can belong to several groups, and can chat with the users of the groups they belong to and send photos to these groups during the conversation.

I helped develop this app with several colleagues (including Gabriel Freitas, from whom I have forked this repository he set up as an archive) in my time at Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa.
